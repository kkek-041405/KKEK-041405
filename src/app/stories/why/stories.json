Calls kept coming in, messages kept piling up, and I couldn’t respond. Buying a new phone wasn’t an option, so I was stuck with a fully functioning device that I could do nothing with."

It felt absurd that a slab of working hardware was useless just because I couldn’t tap the right pixels. I didn’t need sympathy. **I needed access.**"

I started with the bare minimum: an app that could dial pre-stored contacts and answer incoming calls. It wasn’t pretty, but it gave my phone a pulse again. That small win **changed everything.**"

        "title": "What I Built",
        "content": "The first version was simple: **calls in and calls out without touching the display**. Then I expanded it — music control, toggling features, basic automation. With each update, **the screen mattered less**.\n\nEventually the idea shifted from controlling a *broken* phone to **controlling a phone hands-free**.\n\nThat’s when **ZenControl** was born — a personal on-device assistant that executes commands directly:\n\n```\n“Turn on the hotspot.”\n“Play music.”\n“Call Dad.”\n```\nNo typing, no swiping — **just intent → action.**"

        "content": "Instead of buying a new phone, I **repurposed a broken one into something more powerful**. ZenControl didn’t just save money — it unlocked control in situations where touchscreens normally fail:\n- driving\n- multitasking\n- accessibility challenges\n- low-vision use cases\n\nA device that was once **unusable** became **effortless**."

      {
        "title": "What It Taught Me",
        "content": "Limitations aren’t obstacles — **they're pressure**. Pressure forces clarity. Pressure forces innovation.\n\nZenControl started because I couldn’t afford a new phone. It grew because I **refused to settle for inconvenience**.\n\nNow I approach every problem with a single question:\n\n> **Is this truly impossible — or just inconvenient enough that people learn to live with it?**"
